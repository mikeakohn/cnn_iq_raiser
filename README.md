Mozilla extension to filter stupid articles from CNN and clean up other issues with www.cnn.com.

Originally this extension was made to filter out things like The Royal Wedding, Justin Bieber, Octomom,
and other "news" articles that could harm a person's intelligence.  At one time it was also filtering out
user comments since 90% of them were either stupid or hateful.

More recent changes are removing the ticker at the bottom of the front page and I plan on adding a way
to stop their videos from autoplaying.
